# ðŸ§  Brain Hemorrhage Classification & Segmentation  

This repository contains the final project for my **Machine Learning and Statistical Theory course at Northeastern University**, completed in a group of three. The project focuses on using machine learning techniques to **classify and segment brain hemorrhages from medical brain scan images**.  

Our goal was to explore a range of supervised learning methods and deep learning architectures to evaluate their effectiveness on high-dimensional medical imaging data. This repository contains the raw code we used to train and evaluate our models as well as the final paper and presentation that detail our results.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **Domain**: Medical Imaging / Healthcare AI  
- **Objective**: Detect and segment hemorrhages in brain scans.  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Group Size**: 3 students (I contributed to modeling, training, and evaluation).  
- **Data**: Brain scan images provided by local company

## ðŸ§© Methods Implemented
We applied and compared a variety of machine learning and deep learning methods, including:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Tree-Based Methods (Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classification  
- Neural Networks (custom architectures)  
- **U-Net** for medical image segmentation

## ðŸ“Š Results & Insights
- Traditional ML methods (Logistic, QDA, SVM, Trees, kNN) provided baseline performance on classification tasks.  
- Neural networks significantly outperformed classical approaches in capturing complex image features.  
- **U-Net** proved highly effective for pixel-level segmentation, highlighting its utility in medical image analysis.  
- Trade-offs were observed between interpretability (classical ML) and performance (deep learning).
